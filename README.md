# Streamlit - Simple Trading Web App

This web app allows you make some simple technical analysis and position size calculation before entering a trade. I came up with the idea by watching YouTube Videos from [Adam Khoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFHTccTf3QM&list=PLddKKXhQ4Wv9Qx2OeAdR7QQHmNbGJAs4n&index=1)"). For more details, trading strategies I'd highly recommend checking out Adam's videos.  

An article write-up on this project including a description of the current as well as upcoming features will be coming soon.
